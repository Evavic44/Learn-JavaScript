## Coding Challenge 4 🎉

```js
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant, In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called "tip" for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😿 (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)

2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: "The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25"

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40, 430
```
