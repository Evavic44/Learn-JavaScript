## 🎉 Coding Challenge 2

```
Use the BMI example from Challenege #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"

2. Use a template string to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's BMI (23.9)!"

Hint: Use an if/else statement. 😉

GOOD LUCK 🤩
```

## Solution

```js
// TEST 1
const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

// TEST 2
// const massMark = 95;
// const heightMark = 1.88;
// const massJohn = 85;
// const heightJohn = 1.76;

const johnBMI = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
const markBMI = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
  console.log(
    `Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's BMI (${johnBMI}) 💙`
  );
} else {
  console.log(
    `John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) 💜`
  );
}
